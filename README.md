## About
This is a simple messaging application in Java, which allows multiple user clients to chat with each other, with the help of a single server client. With no upper limit on the number of clients that can be handled at a time, this application is suited for broadcast messaging to multiple users.

This was developed as a beginner level project for Winter Practical Training Evaluation in 4th Semester of B.E. Computer Engineering.
